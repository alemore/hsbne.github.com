# Social media on behalf of HSBNE

## YouTube
HSBNE has a YouTube channel.

You are welcome and encouraged to post content under it's banner to help promote HSBNE.

The goal is to showcase and celebrate the activities of the members, the space itself and a general enthusiasm for the act of creation.

You would be given access to post to HSBNE's channel 

### Guidelines
Usual étiquette applies as per the <a href="/admin/code">Code of Conduct</a>,<a href="/admin/safespace">Safe Space Policy</a> and <a href="/admin/dressandpresentation">Dress and presentation</a> policies.

That is to say, do not use YouTube as a platform to be mean to others (take personal beefs offline), do not do unsafe things (poor safety, put yourself or others in danger) and do not put yourself on camera in an unflattering way (would your grandma be happy to see you do this?).
Other than that, feel free to share your interests and experiences in the way you feel best able to do so.

#### Does it have to be good quality and well produced?

NO! Part of the appeal is that you bring your genuine experience to the channel.
That might mean a quick hand held camera phone taking a poorly lit and wobble video of your subject in action. It might be a professionally lit and produces hour long documentary. You bring what you have to the table.

### Does HSBNE own the video from now on? Can I retract it?
You still own the video. If you want it removed, you can do so directly or ask someone with appropriate permissions to do so for you.

### What should I post then?

Most anything that shows off the space, shows off individuals achievements and generally promotes the space (and yourself) in a positive manor.


#### Examples?
##### The space itself
